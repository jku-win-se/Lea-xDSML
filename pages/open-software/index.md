    <h4>RL4MT:</h4> This project demonstrates the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for rule-orchestrated model transformations. In that matter, the MOMoT Framework is employed which represents problem domains by means of Ecore meta-models and problem instances as models to be optimized through executing graph transformation rules. The framework is extended by two different RL approaches, named value-based and policy-based, which portray alternative optimization methods to so far implemented metaheuristics for finding valuable rule compositions. The project includes case studies that primarily evaluate the RL agents against the Non-Dominated Sorting Algorithm (NSGA-II) and demonstrate the feasibility of RL methods for search-based model optimization.
