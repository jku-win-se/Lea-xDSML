    <h4>RL4MT:</h4> This project demonstrates the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for rule-orchestrated model transformations. In that matter, the MOMoT Framework is employed which represents problem domains by means of Ecore meta-models and problem instances as models to be optimized through executing graph transformation rules. The framework is extended by two different RL approaches, named value-based and policy-based, which portray alternative optimization methods to so far implemented metaheuristics for finding valuable rule compositions. The project includes case studies that primarily evaluate the RL agents against the Non-Dominated Sorting Algorithm (NSGA-II) and demonstrate the feasibility of RL methods for search-based model optimization.

    <h4>CoQuaDe:</h4>  is a modeling language and design framework for quantum circuits. This language allow the definition of composite operators advocating a higher-level quantum algorithm design, together with automated code generation for the circuit execution. The proposed approach comes with a separation of the quantum operation definitions from the quantum circuit syntax, which allows for an independent design and the use of customized libraries.
