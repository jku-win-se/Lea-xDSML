**LEA xDSML** is a research project concerned with language engineering methods for executable modeling languages. This project started in July 2018 at [TU Wien](https://modelexecution.org/lea/) and was moved in January 2019 to [JKU Linz](https://se.jku.at/lea-language-engineering-for-analyzable-executable-dsmls/). Currently, it is carried out by the Software Engineering Department at JKU and funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF. This project will run for three years. 

**Context**

LEA xDSML resides in the context of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), which proposes the use of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) to reduce the complexity associated with the development of complex software-intensive systems, as, for instance, found in the automation domain, production domain, and automotive domain.

DSMLs are increasingly being developed to continuously leverage the domain-specific expertise of the various stakeholders involved in the development of complex system. Thereby, the integration of domain-specific knowledge into DSMLs can significantly improve the productivity of the development process and the quality of the final system. However, the development of DSMLs has also been recognized as a challenging and significant software engineering task itself.
